# Inclusion Criteria

The criteria for a product to be listed in this project are:
* First and foremost, ICS defenders must find it useful.
* It must be a real product. No vapourware. 
* Products must be generally available across a large part of the world. It's no use if it can't be bought in many parts of the world.
* Products can be hardware or software. Their licensing model can be anything including regular subscription.
* Open source and other types of free product are very welcome.
* Services will not be listed. They may be great, but this project exists to list products.
* Obsolete products will be removed. No-one wants to buy a product the vendor has dropped.
* Vendors are welcome to submit their own products, but must declare their interest. See the [Contribution Guidelines](Contributing.md).
* If any products listed are not useful, e.g poor quality or dropped by the vendor, please [notify us](Contributing.md).

Links from this project are mainly to the vendor's website homepage. Vendors should make it easy to find their products. However in the case of important vendors with monolithic, unnavigable websites (looking at you, Siemens), links may be to a product page within a website.

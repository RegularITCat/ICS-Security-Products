# Inclusion Criteria

The criteria for a product to be listed in this project are:
* First and foremost, ICS defenders must find it useful.
* It must be a real product. No vapourware. 
* Products must be generally available across a large part of the world. It's no use if you can't buy it (see vapourware).
* Products can be hardware or software. Their licensing model can be anything including regular subscription.
* Open source and other types of free product are very welcome.
* Services will not be listed. They may be great, but this project exists to list products.
* Obsolete products will be removed. No-one wants to buy a product the vendor has dropped.
* Reputable sources are required. Products from  APT crews are not welcome here. 
* Vendors are welcome to submit their own products, but must declare their interest. See the [Contribution Guidelines](Contributing.md).
* Products must either be ICS-specific, or particularly useful in an ICS environment (e.g. Diodes). There are too many corporate cybersecurity products out there that can be applied to ICS to usefully list. 
* ICS-specific modules for corporate cybersecurity products are welcome.
* If any products listed are not useful, e.g poor quality or dropped by the vendor, please [notify us](Contributing.md).

Links from this project are mainly to the vendor's website homepage. Vendors should make it easy to find their products. However in the case of important vendors with monolithic, unnavigable websites (looking at you, Siemens), links may be to a product page within a website.

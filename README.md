# ICS-Security-Products
Many discussion threads in ICS security internet forums are people asking for product recommendations. There is normally good response to this type of posts, but they all exist in little silos, dotted around the interent which makes them hard to find.

This project is an attempt to solve the problem of knowing where to go to find out about useful products in the ICS security space. It is inspired by @Ka0sKl0wN's list of ICS Security study resources at https://github.com/Ka0sKl0wN/ICS-Security-Study-Resources

It is not exhaustive. It is vendor-neutral. The key requirement for a product being on a list is that ICS/OT defenders find it useful for securing their environments.
